Once upon a time (back in 2014), we started a coding school in a temporary classroom in Camden Town. It was just an experiment, so we ran it for free. Word got around that there was this free training available and applications turned from a trickle to a torrent. 

Over the years, we have tried different ways to fund ourselves, including setting up a co-operative software agency (not easy to do with a bunch of absolute beginners), applying for public funds (hard to justify when many of our beneficiaries are well-educated 20-somethings), global expansion (that actually worked for a time and has left a successful legacy in parts of the Middle East) and acting as an employment agency (which was quite successful until the global pandemic struck). 

Now, we are an apprenticeship training provider. We continue to be the route into a career as a software developer for a wide range of people from many different backgrounds, particularly those under-represented in software development. Founders & Coders C.I.C. is an employee-run community interest company.
