## Check your eligibility

In order to apply to our 24-week programme, you must:

- Live in London
- Be over 18 years old
- Be [eligible to apply for an apprenticeship](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules-for-employers/annex-a-eligibility-criteria-who-we-fund)
- Speak conversational English ([we're not sticklers on grammar](https://wearyourvoicemag.com/language-purists-white-supremacy-classism/))

## Pre-application stage

1. ### Submit your expression of interest

   Please [submit an Expression of Interest](/forms/express-interest/). This lets us keep track of who is interested and gives us your contact details.

1. ### Start learning HTML and CSS

   Please complete the following modules on freeCodeCamp in your own time:

   - [Basic HTML and HTML5](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/) (28 modules)
   - [Basic CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css/) (44 modules)

1. ### Create a tribute page

   Follow the instructions to [create and submit a tribute page website](/forms/tribute/) and demonstrate your learnings. This should take no more than 2-4 hours.

1. ### Wait for the Discord invitation

   We will admit up to 80 people per application cycle. We will also close invites six weeks before the application deadline. We strongly recommend you don't wait until the last moment to submit your tribute page. The remaining application requirements are considerably more work.

## Application stage

1. ### Join our Discord community

   Our online community is full of other people learning to code and hoping to apply for our programme.
   
   You can attend meetups and workshops, and work together on coding problems with other applicants.

1. ### Finish the course requirements

   Work through all the rest of [our course requirements](#application-requirements). This is where you will spend the bulk of your self-learning time during the application cycle.

   Someone with no prior coding experience can expect to take at least three months of dedicated work to complete these. Some people take six months to a year. Other bootcamps sell the idea of learning to code in 12 weeks, but we think this is unrealistic and misleading.

1. ### Apply for the course

   Applications will open during the final week of the cycle. If you have completed the previous steps and are part of our Discord community will be invited to apply during this time.

1. ### Receive a response

   If your application is successful you will be invited to interview. If we think you would benefit from some more time to learn we may invite you to re-apply for the next cohort.

   If you don't receive an interview don't be too disheartened. We believe our course requirements are a great step on your journeyâ€”plenty of people continue self-learning and become developers without our programme.

## Application requirements

**Before we will consider your application, you must complete the following tasks:**

1. ### Create a GitHub account

   You will use this account to host the repository of your application website.

1. ### freeCodeCamp

   Complete [these sections of freeCodeCamp's curriculum](/requirements/freecodecamp)

1. ### Codewars

   Complete all of [these Codewars challenges](/requirements/codewars).

1. ### Create a personal website

   Create a website demonstrating what you've learned. It must fulfill all of [these required criteria](/requirements/website).

## What kind of people are we looking for?

We get asked this a lot, so we're going to elaborate a little bit here. Firstly, we prioritise a cohesive cohort of people who we think will work well together over any strong individual candidates.

Learning to code is just part of what makes you a good developer. We're looking for candidates who can help us fulfil our goal of making the tech industry a more diverse and inclusive place. This means people who are excited to be part of a collaborative, peer-led learning environment. You should be willing to sacrifice some personal gain for the group's learning. For example, we'd rather a group presents a technically incomplete project than one person stays up late writing code that no one else understands.

The tech industry is disproportionately white, male and university-educated. If this describes you please reflect on how you can help change this. Do some research on [how to be a good ally](https://www.guidetoallyship.com) to those who are under-represented in tech so you can be a positive influence on your cohort.

Finding your own solutions to problems is an indispensable skill for a developer. We'd like you to apply these same google-skills to educating yourself on the important social issues including (but not limited to) those touched on above.

Founders and Coders will always prioritise marginalised people's safety over the comfort of the privileged. **If you don't like the sound of any of this then we'd ask you to reconsider your application.**
