## How do I apply?

1. ### Check your eligibility

   In order to apply to our full-time programme, you must:

   - Be over 18 years old
   - Have the right to work in the UK
   - Speak conversational English (and no, [we're not sticklers on grammar](https://wearyourvoicemag.com/language-purists-white-supremacy-classism/))

1. ### Submit your expression of interest and join our online community

   Please [submit an Expression of Interest](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSepdNxKsrMjhfnbdkzKUgNpeWFmp8WLyiqTe_UY10TsPpFOEQ/viewform) to get invited to our Slack workspace.

   Introduce yourself in our Slack workspace where you can find the most up-to-date information on our programme, meetups, and ask us any questions you may have.

   We encourage all applicants to actively participate in our online community and learn collaboratively with each other.

1. ### Start work on the application requirements

   While we don't like to suggest how long it will take you to complete the requirements, it's different for everyone, we expect you to take **at least three months** if you don't have any prior experience with web development.

   We especially welcome applicants to work through the material with other applicants, both online and through our meetups.

1. ### Submit an application

   Plan to spend about an hour completing the application form during the application window.

   If you submit your application before the deadline, keep working on the requirements and tidying up your website. We will evaluate your progress as of the date the window closes.

## What kind of people are we looking for?

We get asked this a lot, so we're going to elaborate a little bit here. Firstly, we prioritise a cohesive cohort of people who we think will work well together over any strong individual candidates.

Learning to code is just part of what makes you a good developer. We're looking for candidates who can help us fulfil our goal of making the tech industry a more diverse and inclusive place. This means people who are excited to be part of a collaborative, peer-led learning environment. You should be willing to sacrifice some personal gain for the group's learning. For example, we'd rather a group presents a technically incomplete project than one person stays up late writing code that no one else understands.

The tech industry is disproportionately white, male and university-educated. If this describes you please reflect on how you can help change this. Do some research on [how to be a good ally](https://www.guidetoallyship.com) to those who are under-represented in tech so you can be a positive influence on your cohort.

Finding your own solutions to problems is an indispensable skill for a developer. We'd like you to apply these same google-skills to educating yourself on the important social issues including (but not limited to) those touched on above.

Founders and Coders will always prioritise marginalised people's safety over the comfort of the privileged. **If you don't like the sound of any of this then we'd ask you to reconsider your application.**
