- ### What is the recommended apprentice salary?

  Our recommended apprentice starting salary is Â£24,000, paid from the beginning of your apprenticeship training, beginning in mid-April.

- ### Why aren't apprenticeships starting at the same time as the bootcamp?

  We need to prepare you for your interviews with employers. For our last coding bootcamp of 2020, interviews did not start until the 17th week of the full-time programme. This time we are splitting the programme into two parts: pre-apprenticeship bootcamp and apprenticeship training.

- ### How many employers have signed up to interview apprentice candidates?

  We will be releasing the initial list of employers in the first half of February and then updating it weekly.

- ### What if I am still in full-time employment during the part-time pre-apprenticeship programme?

  We will record any talks or workshops that you cannot attend and arrange the weekly tutorial sessions at a time when you are available.

- ### Can I continue to receive Universal Credit before securing an apprenticeship?

  The short answer is, "yes". The longer answer is that we can negotiate on your behalf with your Job Centre to ensure that there is no interruption in your payments while attending the pre-apprenticeship programme. You will need to contact us about this as soon as possible.

- ### What if I have not secured an apprenticeship by April 12th?

  You can continue on the programme regardless of whether you have secured an apprenticeship and we will continue to actively seek apprenticeship opportunities for you.

- ### Am I guaranteed an apprenticeship if I want one?

  We offer no guarantees of an apprenticeship, but we would not have accepted you onto this programme if we did not think you were capable of securing one and it is very much in our interests to secure you an apprenticeship as soon as we are able.

- ### When will I start being paid?
  You can usually expect your first salary to be paid at the end of the first calendar month in which you begin your apprenticeship. Exact details of payment may differ from employer to employer.
