title: Candidate journey
---

1. Once an eligible candidate is accepted into our applicant pool, they are invited to join our Discord server, where we encourage them to actively participate in our online community and learn collaboratively with each other;
1. They start work on our application requirements, which typically take at least three months to complete;
1. When the candidate is ready, they complete an application to our pre-apprenticeship programme during which they will be prepared for interviews with employers;
1. After the candidate successfully interviews with an employer and accepts an apprenticeship offer, they join the payroll of their new employer and start on their apprenticeship training;
1. After a minimum of 12 months, the apprentice can enter the end-point 'gateway';
1. Within 13-18 months, the apprentice completes their apprenticeship when they pass their end-point assessment.
