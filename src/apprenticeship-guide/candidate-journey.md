title: Candidate journey
---

1. Once an interested candidate completes an expression of interest, they are invited to join our Discord server, where we encourage them to actively participate in our online community and learn collaboratively with each other;
1. They start work on our application requirements, which typically take at least three months to complete;
1. When the candidate is ready, they complete an application to our 12-week pre-apprenticeship programme.
1. Entry to the programme, which runs three times a year, is competitive and over-subscribed;
1. After securing a place, the candidate joins the pre-apprenticeship programme;
1. Towards the end of the programme, the candidates interview with employers;
1. After the candidate accepts an apprenticeship offer, the apprentice joins the payroll of their new employer and starts their 12-week apprenticeship block training with us;
1. After the training, the apprentice joins their employer on a full-time basis;
1. After 12 months, the apprentice can enter the end-point 'gateway';
1. Within 13-18 months, the apprentice completes their apprenticeship by passing their end-point assessment.
