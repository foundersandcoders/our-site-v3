title: Candidate journey
---

1. An interested candidate completes an expression of interest on our website;
1. The candidate is invited to join our online forum for applicants and is invited to join a number of community events, workshops and meetups each month;
1. The candidate starts work on the course entry requirements online; this process can take anything from 1 to 6 months of self-paced study;  
   Alternatively, the candidate is referred onto our coaching programme through Islington Councilâ€™s Adult Community Learning website, where they will get ongoing support in completing the course entry requirements;

1. The candidate completes an application in the application window, which opens three times each year;
1. The applicant is short-listed typically from over 50 applicants who have completed the course entry requirements (and over 1,200 candidates who have expressed interest in the programme in the previous year) for an interview and technical test, along with up to 31 other applicants;
1. The candidate is offered a place on our pre-apprenticeship training programme along with 15 other successful candidates;
1. After securing a place on the programme, the candidate joins a two-month pre-apprenticeship training, initially on a part-time basis for one month;
1. The pre-apprenticeship programme ends with a one-month full-time bootcamp, focusing on software development fundamentals, interview preparation and employer engagement;
1. Towards the end of the bootcamp, the candidates interview with employers for apprenticeships;
1. After the candidate accepts an apprenticeship offer, the apprentice joins the company and starts the two-month apprenticeship training;
1. If the learner does not immediately secure an apprenticeship, they may continue learning alongside the apprentices while we attempt to secure an apprenticeship for them;
1. After two months' apprenticeship training, the apprentice joins their employer on a full-time basis;
1. After 12 months, the apprentice completes their apprenticeship by passing an end-point assessment.
