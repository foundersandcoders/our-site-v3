**What is the recommended apprentice salary?**

Our recommended apprentice starting salary is £24,000, paid from the beginning of their apprenticeship training, beginning in mid-April.

**How long does the apprenticeship last?**

Not less than 12 months. It ends when the apprentice completes their end-point assessment.

**Who is responsible for the end-point assessment?**

The [British Computer Society](https://www.bcs.org/develop-your-people/develop-your-team-or-organisation/digital-it-apprenticeships-for-your-team/bcs-end-point-assessment/).

**When will the apprentice expect a pay rise?**

Certainly after they pass their end-point assessment. Possibly, while they are still doing their apprenticeship, if their preformance warrants it.

**What additional support will you provide after the initial two-month block training?**

1. Regular monthly pastoral care for the apprentice from an assigned mentor
2. Regular monthly checkins with the employer, or as requested
3. Preparation for the end-point assessment
4. Additional training in response to employer needs, as requested

**Will there need to be any training in the second year?**

If the end-point assessment is not completed within 12 months, then additional training may be desirable and necessary, equivalent to one day per week, to support the apprentice through their end-point assessment.

**How much does the training cost?**

The apprenticeship training is funded entirely by the apprenticeship levy and by levy transfers. If you need to access levy transfers, we can put you in touch with [London Progression Collaboration](https://www.thelpc.uk/), who can provide more information.

**Once we have used up our levy, can we still get levy transfer payments?**

If you are a levy payer, but only have a small sum in your levy fund, you can instead fund the apprenticeship through a levy transfer. We can put you in touch with [London Progression Collaboration](https://www.thelpc.uk/), who can provide more information.
