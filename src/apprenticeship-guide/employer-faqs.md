- ### What is the recommended apprentice salary?

  Our recommended apprentice starting salary is £24,000, paid from the beginning of their apprenticeship training, beginning in mid-April.

- ### How long does the apprenticeship last?

  Typically within 13-15 months. It ends when the apprentice completes their end-point assessment.

- ### Who is responsible for the end-point assessment?

  The [British Computer Society](https://www.bcs.org/develop-your-people/develop-your-team-or-organisation/digital-it-apprenticeships-for-your-team/bcs-end-point-assessment/).

- ### When will the apprentice expect a pay rise?

  They are likely to expect a significat pay rise after they pass their end-point assessment. 

- ### What additional support will you provide after the initial two-month block training?

  1. Regular monthly pastoral care for the apprentice from an assigned mentor
  1. Regular monthly tutorials for the apprentice
  1. Regular monthly checkins with the employer, or as requested
  1. Preparation for the end-point assessment, starting after 12 months
  1. Additional training in response to employer needs, as requested

- ### Will there need to be any training after 15 months?

  If the end-point assessment is not completed within 15 months, then additional training may be desirable and necessary, equivalent to one day per week, to support the apprentice through their end-point assessment.

- ### How much does the training cost?

  The apprenticeship training is funded entirely by the apprenticeship levy and by levy transfers. If you need to access levy transfers, we can put you in touch with [London Progression Collaboration](https://www.thelpc.uk/), who can provide more information.

- ### Once we have used up our levy, can we still get levy transfer payments?

  If you are a levy payer, but only have a small sum in your levy fund, you can instead fund the apprenticeship through a levy transfer. We can put you in touch with [London Progression Collaboration](https://www.thelpc.uk/), who can provide more information.
  
- ### What incentive payments are available for hiring a new apprentice?

  The Government has recently announced a doubling of the value of their incentive payments to employers to £3,000. For more information, see [incentive payments for hiring a new apprentice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/incentive-payments-for-hiring-a-new-apprentice).
