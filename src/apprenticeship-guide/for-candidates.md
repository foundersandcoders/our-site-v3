title: For candidates
---

After applications close on January 10th, we will be inviting 32 candidates to interview with us January 18-22nd. Candidates will be notified by January 25th whether they have been successful in filling one of the 16 places on the programme.

The FAC21 part-time pre-course starts in the first week of February and then goes full-time on March 8. The apprenticeship training starts on April 12. Throughout March and into April we will be holding interviews with employers. We expect programme participants to begin receiving apprentice offers from the end of March onwards.

This is the first time that Founders and Coders has provided the option of taking an apprenticeship to our programme participants and it is the first time that many of our employers have offered apprenticeships.

Our aim is to find an apprenticeship for every programme participant that wants one.
