What sets our apprenticeship apart is the size, quality and diversity of our applicant pool; the level of candidate preparation; and the quality of our training.

We have selected 16 candidates drawn from a large pool of applicants. They started a pre-apprenticeship programme with us at the beginning of February that ends on April 10th. Apprenticeship interviews start in March. Once hired, apprentices start their apprenticeship training with us on April 13th and will then be ready to join their employers on June 14th.

The _Founders and Coders_ apprenticeship training is recognised by the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA). It follows the [Level 4 Software Developer apprenticeship standard](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/media/4392/software-developer-st0116-standard.pdf), which we expect the apprentices to complete in 12 months, with most of the training taking place in the first two months of the apprenticeship.

As with all apprenticeships, the apprentice is expected to spend at least 20% of their time engaged in off-the-job training. End-point assessments are carried out by the [British Computer Society](https://www.bcs.org/deliver-and-teach-qualifications/training-providers-and-adult-education-centres/deliver-digital-it-apprenticeships/end-point-assessment-for-training-providers/). There are no significant restrictions placed by the ESFA on the age of an apprentice or on their academic background.

The _Founders and Coders_ programme follows the new Software Developer standard and focuses on the modern Web stack: JavaScript, HTML & CSS; Git; HTTP; testing; Node.js & Express; SQL & databases; APIs, authentication & security; continuous integration & deployment; SPAs & React.

Immediately after the apprentice is hired, they start their apprenticeship training with us, before joining you on a full-time basis after two months. _Founders and Coders_ will continue to provide support to both employer and apprentice throughout the length of the apprenticeship until the apprentice is fully prepared for, and passes, their end-point assessment.

We are partnering with the [London Progression Collaboration](https://www.thelpc.uk/) to keep the administrative burden on employers to a minimum. Through the LPC, employers who are not already paying the apprenticeship levy will be able to access funding to ensure that there will be no apprenticeship training fees to pay.
