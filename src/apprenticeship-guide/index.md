### What apprenticeship do we offer?

The _Founders and Coders_ programme follows the new [Level 4 Software Developer apprenticeship standard](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/media/4392/software-developer-st0116-standard.pdf) and focuses on the modern Web stack: JavaScript, HTML & CSS; Git; HTTP; testing; Node.js & Express; SQL & databases; APIs, authentication & security; continuous integration & deployment; SPAs & React.

### How long does the apprenticeship last?

The apprenticeship ends when the apprentice completes their end-point assessment with the [British Computer Society](https://www.bcs.org/develop-your-people/develop-your-team-or-organisation/digital-it-apprenticeships-for-your-team/bcs-end-point-assessment/), typically within 15 months and usually after no more than 18 months. 

### How is the training divided up?

  1. Full-time block training in the first 12 weeks of employment;
  1. Weekly day release for as long as is useful to both employer and apprentice, typically for 4-8 weeks; 
  1. Up to 5 days of supervised mentorship;
  1. Preparation for the end-point assessment.
  
### When does the apprentice contract end?

  The primary purpose of an apprenticeship is the training of the apprentice. Apprentices are considered to be employees from the day their apprenticeship starts. Once the apprenticeship comes to an end, the apprenticeship contract will usually also end. If the apprentice is to continue with the employer after they complete their apprenticeship, they would normally expect to sign a new contract at a new salary. 
  
### What is the recommended apprentice salary?

  Our recommended apprentice starting salary is £24,000, paid from the beginning of their apprenticeship training.

### How much does the training cost?

  The apprenticeship training can be funded entirely through the apprenticeship levy or, for non-levy payers, through levy transfers, which we can arrange through the [London Progression Collaboration](https://www.thelpc.uk/). 
  
### What incentive payments are available for hiring a new apprentice?

  The Government has recently announced a temporary doubling of the value of their incentive payments to employers to £3,000. For more information, see [incentive payments for hiring a new apprentice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/incentive-payments-for-hiring-a-new-apprentice).
