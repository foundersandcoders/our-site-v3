## Who we are

This privacy notice explains how we collect and use your personal information for the purposes of evaluating the Employer Led Training Initiatives/Skills Bootcamps. This data is being collected by the DfE for the National Skills Fund.

For the purposes of relevant data protection legislation, the Department for Education (DfE) is the data controller for personal information processed for this research. More information about how the DfE handles personal information is published here:
https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education/about/personal-information-charter

## Why we collect your personal information

We are collecting data on Skills Bootcamp applicants, candidates, and participants to help the DfE understand how well the courses are working and if they are achieving their outcomes. This is important because it allows us to be transparent about how government spends public money and measures the impact that policies are having, as well as helping us make improvements to future training courses. This data also helps us check if the people who are on the course do complete the course and ensures that the correct amount of funding is paid.

## The nature of your personal data we will be using

As part of the data collection we are asking for your personal data;

- national insurance number,
- first name,

- date of birth
- education and qualifications information

- benefits information
- caring responsibilities

The special category data we will be processing includes:

- gender
- disability and
- ethnicity

As part of our work to evaluate the effectiveness of Skills Bootcamps in supporting people to gain employment and higher incomes we will link this data to records on education and training, income, employment and benefits which are held by the Department for Education, the Department of Work and Pensions and Her Majesty’s revenue and customs. This is to evaluate the programme’s overall impact. For more information on this, please look at our supplementary materials.

## Our legal basis for collecting your personal information

## How we use your personal information

Personal information collected from research participants is treated as confidential and collected for research purposes contract management assurance purposes and to prevent the risk of fraud. Any information shared publicly will be anonymised so you cannot be identified.

## Who we will make your personal data available to

We sometimes need to make personal data available to other organisations. These include contracted partners whom we may employ to process your personal data on our behalf and/or other organisations (with whom we need to share your personal data for specific purposes). We plan to track participants’ longer-term outcomes through links to administrative data held by DfE, DWP and HMRC.
