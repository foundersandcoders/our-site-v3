This is for Wednesday, October 7th from 16:30 to 18:00.

Please make sure to read this carefully on how our meetups are changing (to the new coaching sessions) before signing up: https://bit.ly/3cHNOir

Sign up will close on noon the day of the session. We should have capacity for 16-24 people â€” you will receive an email with log in instructions by 13:00 the day of the session.

Please note we're currently operating with a three-strike policy, where if you miss more than three then you'd have to wait four weeks before signing up again, so please only sign up to our meetups if you're able to attend.
