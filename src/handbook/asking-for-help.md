title: How to ask for coding help
---

- something about how to use [repl.it](http://repl.it) or code snippet or link to Codewars katas etc.
- Maybe threads in Slack as well
- Maybe start them young on 20-20-20? We'd hope that they rely on other applicants first, then current FAC, then FAC staff

## Before you ask

Make sure you have tried researching the problem yourself. Getting good at googling and interpreting answers on Stack Overflow or GitHub is a very important skill.

## Our Slack community

There are always lots of people happy to answer questions on our Slack. We have a few guidelines to make this smooth for everyone:

1. Ask in the right channel. There are separate channels for CodeWars, freeCodeCamp etc.
2. Share a link to your code on [repl.it](http://repl.it). That way others can see (and run) the code you've tried.
3. Share a link to the original problem (e.g. the CodeWars kata or the freeCodeCamp exercise).
4. Explain what you've tried so far, and what you've already found from researching. Otherwise people may suggest things you know won't work.

If you're _helping_ others on Slack please use the threads feature to reply directly to their message. This prevents the main channel from becoming too clogged with individual conversation.

## Who should answer questions?

The short answer is: everyone!
