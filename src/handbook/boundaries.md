title: Boundaries
---

Every successful relationship starts with a clear set of boundaries. Your relationship as an applicant with Founders and Coders is no different. Boundaries help us make sure we are providing a safe learning environment for students and safe working environment for our staff.

We will always strive to make any Founders and Coders space (online or in-person) a warm and inviting place for collaborative learning, but sometimes things can get personal. Setting boundaries help make sure you don’t expect us to be something we’re not.

## Communications

We love your questions, but as a small core team of four we simply do not have the capacity to answer all of your direct messages on Slack.

Direct messages on Slack gives the impression that we are always available to answer your messages, it’s **not accurate** and **not the perception** we want to give our applicants.

Founders and Coders has always been and will always be a peer-led learning environment. This means we want people who are interested in our programme to demonstrate that they value transparent conversations and a willingness to engage with other applicants. We're definitely not the only ones qualified to answer coding questions and would encourage all applicants to chime in and help us foster a collaborative and welcoming digital space.

The **only way** to reach Founders and Coders staff is through the following channels:

- Ask us your question publicly in any of our channels on Slack, but we encourage using #ask-fac
- Ask us at one our meetups (in person or remotely)
- For private matters, please send us an email to [hello@foundersandcoders.com](mailto:hello@foundersandcoders.com)

We will no longer respond to any direct messages on Slack, but will always kindly remind you to use the above methods when needing to speak with us.

## Application extensions

We do not offer extensions, so please don’t ask for one.

Applying for Founders and Coders takes time, and an extension will in no way make up for the 2-3 months it normally takes to complete our prerequisites.

With that said, if you have been coming to meetups regularly and for whatever reason came quite close to finishing the prerequisite by the deadline but didn't — we would be interested in hearing why.

## Application feedback

According to About page, [we don't provide individualised feedback](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/about/#can-you-tell-me-why-i-wasn-t-admitted-or-give-me-feedback-on-my-application). However, we've broken that rule we set for ourselves many times and the result isn't always great for us. Moving forward, we're re-enforcing the no indivisualised feedback rule.

Our friends at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/feedback) wrote a little bit on their admissions feedback approach, which resonated a lot with us. We've linked to it but will also share it again below:

_We don’t give feedback about our admissions decisions. We realize this can be frustrating, so we want to explain why._

\*The short version is: We gave feedback in the past, it took a lot of time, and we don’t think it was very effective for us or for applicants.

Here’s the longer answer.

For many batches, we gave applicants the most helpful and honest feedback we could. We didn’t always get back to everyone (and sometimes it took us way too long to respond) but on the whole, we shared candid feedback with the majority of people who asked for it.

This process was time-consuming and dreadful in the literal sense of the word. We spent hours trying to figure out how to give helpful and honest advice, and we spent even more time feeling guilty about not getting back to people or not getting back to people fast enough.

The results were not encouraging. People would reply and try to contest our decisions, get frustrated that our responses weren’t specific enough, or otherwise indicate that our feedback wasn’t very productive.

This is understandable, especially for folks who don’t get in. Most people are justifiably disappointed when this happens, and it’s not fun hearing feedback from someone who’s spent at most 20 or 30 minutes with you. Giving and receiving feedback is hard, and it’s doubly so when both parties don’t have a strong existing relationship with each other.

Like any admissions process, ours is far from perfect, and we know we make mistakes. We have to make decisions based on a relatively small amount of information, and even if we do a good job 90% of the time (which is probably way too generous to us), we’re still going to get it wrong dozens of times a batch.\*

Like Recurse Center's admissions process, as with any other, ours is also far from perfect. We will continue to try our best to admit a diverse cohort of individuals who we think will thrive in our cooperative learning community. Joining Founders and Coders is just one of many pathways to becoming a developer.
