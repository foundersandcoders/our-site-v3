title: Grounds for removal
---

Unfortunately, to maintain safety of our learning spaces, we will remove you from our Slack and/or ask you to leave our physical space if we observe the following:

## Violation of our code of conduct or repeated violation of our social rules

_It doesn't feel like it needs to be said, but we'll say it again: please be respectful to everyone. Any violation of our code of conduct will result in immediate removal from Founders and Coders. This also includes repeated violation of our social rules, repeated unsolicited direct messages, and any abusive behaviour and harassment towards Founders and Coders staff and members._

## Violation of other people's privacy and intellectual property

_Please do not post or link to any private information (yours or other people's). This includes product/API keys, passwords, or any sensitive personally identifiable information. Please do not post anything that may be considered the intellectual property of someone else's without their permission. If you're going to share any screenshots or images over Slack, please make sure it doesn't include any private information._

## Marketing

_You are welcome to post endorsements of tools, products or services that you personally found useful and think could benefit other people's learning. Please refrain from blatant advertising, marketing or any kind of spam. You are not allowed to send affiliate links to third-party services (i.e. clicking on the link or buying the services within would directly or indirectly financially benefit you)._

## Soliciting jobs

_Founders and Coders Slack community is intended as a place for applicants to work collaboratively on our programme prerequisites together. Soliciting job offers through any channel (using LinkedIn, Indeed, or a company website) is not allowed and will be deleted immediately._

## Misuse of **_any_** Founders and Coders learning materials and curriculum

_We wouldn’t have made our curriculum open source if we didn’t believe in opening access to tech education for everyone, even if they don't have a place on one of our cohorts._

_Take a minute to research a bit about open source and understand the ethics (or lack thereof) on claiming other people's work as your own (unintentionally or not)._

_Our curriculum is licensed under Creative Commons (specifically “[Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)”). This means you are free to share and adapt the material, but you **must** give credit to the original author, and you **must** maintain the original license. In other words, you can use our curriculum if you:_

1. _Give Founders and Coders credit for creating it_
2. _Maintain the original license_
3. _Continue to offer it free of charge_

**_What you can do_**

1. _Work through the material yourself, or in groups of like-minded people_
2. _Clone the workshop repos to work on them locally_
3. _Fork the workshop repos so you have a copy on your own GitHub account_

**_What you cannot do_**

1. _Create your own copy of the curriculum with our license removed_
2. _Create your own copies of the workshops by pasting our material into a new repo_
3. _Any other activity that removes attribution or authorship history_
