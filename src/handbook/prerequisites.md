# Prerequisites

This is almost word-for-word what's on our [Apply page](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/apply/), but in a nice checklist if it's helpful 📝

### 1️⃣ GitHub

- [ ]  Create a GitHub account

### 2️⃣ freeCodeCamp

Register for an account and complete the following eight sections:

**Responsive Web Design Certification**

- [ ]  [Basic HTML and HTML5](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/)
- [ ]  [Basic CSS](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/)
- [ ]  [Responsive Web Design Principles](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-principles/)
- [ ]  [CSS Flexbox](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/css-flexbox/)

**JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification**

- [ ]  [Basic JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/)
- [ ]  [ES6](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/)
- [ ]  [Basic Data Structures](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures/)
- [ ]  [Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/)

### 3️⃣ Codewars

- [ ]  **Reach 5 kyu in JavaScript on Codewars.**

You should attempt katas that's reflective of your rank, meaning:

- When you're at 8 kyu, attempt 7-8 kyu katas
- When you're at 7 kyu, attempt 6-7 kyu katas
- When you're at 6 kyu, attempt 5-6 kyu katas
- When you reach 5 kyu, continue with 5-6 kyu katas

We suggest you focus on practical katas that help solidify your JavaScript knowledge. If you find yourself stuck on an intricate maths problem for over two hours, it might be better to move on to a new kata.

### 4️⃣ **Create a personal website**

Your application website needs to be *written by you* and it must fulfill **all** of the following requirements (use this as a checklist, if you will):

- [ ]  Be built in HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript
- [ ]  Tell us about why you are applying for the programme
- [ ]  Be hosted on GitHub
    - Take this opportunity to research a bit on how Git, GitHub and command line works
    - Attempt to [make your commit history tell a story](https://www.mokacoding.com/blog/your-git-log-should-tell-a-story/)

    - [ ]  Be built into your application website (a link to a separate page will not be accepted)
