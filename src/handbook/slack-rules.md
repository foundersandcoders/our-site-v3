title: Our Slack rules

## Getting started

## Etiquette

**Be nice and respectful to everyone**

This is a good rule wherever you are.

If there is someone who isn't behaving well or makes you uncomfortable, be honest with them if you can. If you are uncomfortable doing that or feel the person isn't being receptive, DM an admin and let them know.

For more information, please read our completeÂ [Code of Conduct](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/slack/).

### **Use inclusive language**

Our community is large and diverse. Please consider your choice of words carefully to avoid excluding anyone. For example, when greeting a group of people avoid phrases like "hey guys" (since not everyone is a guy). Try "hey everyone" instead. Also please default to using "they" to refer to someone whose gender or pronouns you do not know.

"Guys" is just one example of language we might choose not to use that reinforces stereotypes about gender and gender identity. We hope everyone who uses our space extends this when they consider language that might reinforce stereotypes including: gender, gender identity, sexuality, disability, race, ethnicity, class or religion.

It's okay to make mistakes as we work on unlearning what we are conditioned by society. We hope you don't mind that our friendly Slackbot will remind you when it spots exclusive language being used ðŸ¤–!

### **Take a look around**

Joining a Slack channel is a lot like walking into a room. Don't just walk in and start talking.

Before you start typing, take a look around. Scroll up (or search through Slack history) and see if your questions has already been answered in a previous thread. See if there is a conversation that is going on. If there is something happening, wait a few minutes to see if the conversation dies down. If not, you can wait until later or simply post a short message to let people know why you joined and what you'd like to discuss/get help with.

### **@here vs @channel vs @mention**

If you want to notify everyone about something important, you should generally useÂ `@here`. This will send a notification to anyone who is in the channel and currently online. You should only use this if you really need everyone online to see your message.

`@channel`Â will send a notification toÂ **everybody in the channel**, whether they're online or not. You probably won't ever need to use this.

You can notify a single person directly withÂ `@mention`. Before you do this consider what timezone they are in and if you are likely to disturb them. You can check someone's timezone in their profile.

### **Use public channels to ask the admins questions**

Our Slack is about communication, so please use the public channels whenever possible. This is good for transparency, but also keeps the community vibrant and alive. You also have an opportunity to help someone else who might find your conversation/question helpful or encouraging. We elaborate a bit more in [Boundaries] @Yvonne Liu on why we don't respond to direct messages.

Please also be sure to check out ourÂ [FAQ](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/about/)Â on our website, some of your questions may already be answered there!

### **Unsolicited private messages (DMs)**

While the community aims to be a place for members of the community to meet and connect, it's also important to respect each other's privacy. Please first ask publicly if you may contact them privately before sending unsolicited messages.

### **Format your messages**

Slack supports bold, italics, code blocks and other formatting. You can use this to make your messages clearer to others. Code blocks especially are helpful when asking for help with your code. ReadÂ [Slack's guide on formatting](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages)Â for some useful tips!

## Channels

### **#announcements**

Everyone will be automatically added into this channel. Only Founders and Coders admins will have posting privileges. This is a good place to watch to have the most up-to-date information on meetups and workshops.

### **#london**

Everyone will be automatically added into this channel. Everyone can post in this channel. This is a good place to get to know other applicants, ask coding related questions, or share cool and interesting resources you've found on the web!

### **#ask-fac**

If you have a question for the admins, here is the place to ask (although using other public channel works for us too).

### **#season-year-applicants**

Browse our list of channels and find the cohort you're interested in applying for. We organise our cohorts by season-year-applicants. For example, if you're interested in applying for the Summer 2020 cohort, the channel name will beÂ `#summer-2020-applicants`:
