title: Changes to our course requirements

We are making some changes to the work we require you to finish before applying to our programme. You can see the full updated requirements [on our Apply page](/apply/#application-requirements).

Don't worry if you've already started working on your requirements for the Spring 2021 cohort. The changes mostly _remove_ work, so we're not adding new stuff you'll have to spend time on. If you have already done some work that's no longer required that's ok too. We see our application process as a great first step to becoming a developer—none of this work is wasted.

## freeCodeCamp

The freeCodeCamp requirements are unchanged. We still think this is a good place to start your journey into web development. We'd recommend working through most of this before starting on the other requirements.

## Codewars

We no longer require you to achieve 5kyu on Codewars. Instead we ask you to complete our list of pre-selected challenges to demonstrate that you are ready for our full-time programme.

We have made these changes to streamline the application process a bit. Codewars generally became a bit of a grind as potential applicants struggled to gain the points required to hit 5kyu. It is also quite hard to judge whether a kata is worth investing time in—some are confusingly worded or very difficult for their rank. We'd rather provide a list of challenges we know are achievable and cover a good spread of different JavaScript features.

That's not to say that you should _only_ do the challenges on our list. Everyone is different, but you'll probably want to get some extra practice as you learn. We leave the choice of where to get this practice up to you. It could be more Codewars kata or it could be something else entirely if you find other applications more interesting.

## Website

We are loosening the website requirements. You no longer _have_ to include an image carousel—you can instead choose to build anything you like as long as it uses JavaScript. We want to see you demonstrate your understanding of JavaScript and the Document Object Model.

The image carousel requirement was intended to assess whether candidates understood how to use JavaScript to manipulate the page. Unfortunately it wasn't as clear as it could have been, and was rather limiting as everyone ended up writing very similar code. We'd rather see applicants express themselves and their creativity through their code, building something they're actually interested in.
