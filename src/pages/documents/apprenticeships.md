# Founders and Coders apprenticeships

## A very brief history

We ran our first coding course in Camden Town in 2014. Over the course of that first year, word spread that there was a “free coding bootcamp” in London and applications grew. By the end of the year, our programme graduates were getting jobs and the companies that had hired them started coming back to us for more. The following year we registered as a community interest company and were on the way to establishing the reputation of our programme.

## Why does our programme produce such good developers?

We are oversubscribed many times over, so we have a big pool of candidates to choose from and we demand a lot of them. Most of them work for months on our prerequisites before they are ready to apply for our programme. We are continually tweaking and updating our curriculum to make it better. 

Another strength of the programme is our curriculum. Our open source coursebook sees a weekly stream of change requests, suggestions and code commits, reflecting the constant flow of feedback from students and updates from staff and volunteers.

We also benefit from an extraordinary alumni community, dozens of whom volunteer every cohort by giving talks or offering mentorship and coaching to our students. 

We focus relentlessly on peer learning, pair programming and on creating an inclusive classroom environment that cultivates developers capable of working both respectfully and productively as part of a team. 

Our aim has always been and will always be to promote inclusion, equity and diversity in tech and our graduates reflect that aim more with each passing year.

## What difference will apprenticeships make?
In one sense apprenticeships will make no difference to the way we operate. We will still have the same fantastic pool of candidates. They will still go through the same excellent programme. They will still be ready for work after four months of full-time study with us.

In another sense, the difference will be profound. By making it possible for students to earn an apprentice wage while they are learning, we will open up this career path to a much wider group of people for whom even a “free” course (with all the costs of living in London) has been previously unaffordable.

We are already ramping up the support we are offering to those candidates who have not previously seen us as a viable option. In a few months, we will have a bigger, broader, and better-prepared candidate pool than ever before.

## How will it work?

We have already started preparing candidates for our first apprenticeship intake in 2021. Interviews will be starting from the end of 2020. And if you have your own candidates, we will, of course, be delighted to work with them. In particular, if you want to support your staff to switch career or to hire people from within the communities you serve, then we can support you with a pre-apprenticeship programme that will ensure your people are ready before they make the full-time switch to software development.

## What do you need to do now?

All we need is an agreement in principle from you to screen and interview candidates. If you don’t find the candidates you want, then we don’t expect you to hire anyone. If your business needs change, we will be starting new cohorts at regular intervals, so that you can hire an apprentice whenever you are ready.

## What will it cost?

If you contribute to the apprenticeship levy, then the cost of this training is already covered. For non-levy payers, the maximum cost of training will be under £1,000. Over the course of their first year, the total cost to you should be less than if you were just to hire a junior developer at the going rate and, in all probability, the outcomes will be better for everyone.

## About us

Founders and Coders CIC is a nonprofit founded in 2014 with a mission to develop more effective and inclusive models of tech training. We are a registered apprenticeship training provider. In 2021 we are launching a new Level 4 software developer apprenticeship programme.

[Our curriculum](https://founders-and-coders.gitbook.io/coursebook/) is open source and used by several other training organisations around the world, including Gaza Sky Geeks in Gaza and the West Bank, Kav-Mashve in Israel, Turn into Coders in Turin, Hack Your Future in Amsterdam, and Umuzi in South Africa.
