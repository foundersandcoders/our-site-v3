# Software Developer Apprenticeships with Founders and Coders

#### Founders and Coders is launching a Software Developer Apprenticeship so that employers can reliably hire diverse, talented and well-trained developers without hiring fees.

## Who are Founders and Coders?
Founders and Coders is a UK-based nonprofit that has been running tuition-free, peer-led training programmes in web development in London since 2014. We have also worked with Mercy Corps and with the UK government to deliver programmes in the Middle East.

## What makes us unique?
We have been able to reliably produce strong alumni for five reasons:
1. Competitive selection
2. Open-source curriculum
3. Peer-led learning
4. Community support
5. A focus on diversity


### Competitive selection: the widest pool and highest entry bar
As we have never charged our students, we are oversubscribed many times over. Our application process requires applicants to complete a series of programming tasks, on which successful candidates will typically work for several months before being ready to apply for the programme.

### Open-source curriculum: modern, relevant and iterative
The [Founders and Coders curriculum](https://founders-and-coders.gitbook.io/coursebook/) is used by several other training organisations around the world. Our coursebook sees a weekly stream of change requests, suggestions and code commits, reflecting the constant flow of feedback from students and updates from staff and volunteers.

### Peer-led learning
We focus relentlessly on peer learning, pair programming and on creating an inclusive classroom environment that cultivates developers capable of working both respectfully and productively as part of a team.

### Community support
We only ever run one cohort at any time, with a fixed cap of 16 learners, because we aren’t willing to trade-off scale for quality of learning. Our learners benefit from an extraordinary alumni community, dozens of whom volunteer every cohort by giving talks or offering mentorship and coaching. 

### A focus on diversity
Our aim has always been and will always be to promote inclusion, equity and diversity in tech and our graduates reflect that aim more with each passing year.

## Why are we starting to do apprenticeships?
Apprenticeships let us go further than our tuition-free programme for the benefit of students and employers.

### For students: making software development even more accessible
By making it possible for students to earn an apprentice wage while they are learning, we will open up this career path to a much wider group of people for whom even a “free” course (with all the costs of living in London) has been previously unaffordable.

### For employers: efficient access to dedicated and diverse developers
By utilising the employers’ Apprenticeship Levy to cover our training costs, we provide you with a more resource-efficient way of accessing our dedicated and diverse developers, even before they graduate. 

## How will the Founders and Coders Apprenticeship work?
We have already started preparing candidates for our first apprenticeship intake in 2021. Interviews will be starting from the end of 2020. And if you have your own candidates, we will, of course, be delighted to work with them. In particular, if you want to support your staff to switch career or to hire people from within the communities you serve, then we can support you with a pre-apprenticeship programme that will ensure your people are ready before they make the full-time switch to software development. 

## What do you need to do now?
All we need is an agreement in principle from you to screen and interview candidates. If you don’t find the candidates you want, then we don’t expect you to hire anyone. If your business needs change, we will be starting new cohorts at regular intervals, so that you can hire an apprentice whenever you are ready. 

## What will it cost?
If you contribute to the apprenticeship levy, then the cost of this training is already covered. For non-levy payers, the maximum cost of training will be under £1,000. Over the course of their first year, the total cost to you should be less than if you were just to hire a junior developer at the going rate and, in all probability, the outcomes will be better for everyone.
