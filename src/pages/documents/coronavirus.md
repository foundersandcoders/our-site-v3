title: Our response to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak
---

The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has had widespread impact. We'd like to provide some clarity to our community on how Founders and Coders is responding, and answer some important questions about our programmes.

As of Monday, March 16 we have moved all of our programmes online. This is an important precaution to ensure the safety of not only our staff and students but the wider population too.

## Applicants

### Are the Monday evening meetups still happening?

All our workshops are now fully online. To get the most up-to-date schedule, please make sure you've [expressed interest](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSepdNxKsrMjhfnbdkzKUgNpeWFmp8WLyiqTe_UY10TsPpFOEQ/viewform) in our London programme and joined us on [Slack](/slack). To ensure a good remote experience we suggest everyone who joins our meetups remotely:

- finds a quiet space with decent internet (if possible)
- uses headphones with a microphone
- registers for a [free Zoom account](https://zoom.us/) and downloads the desktop client before the event

### Is the Summer 2020 cohort still happening?

The Summer 2020 cohort is currently still planned. Weâ€™re keeping an eye on the COVID-19 situation in the UK very carefully, and we are prepared for part of the summer cohort to be remote-first. It's worth noting the spring 2020 cohort is currently being delivered online and going well.

### Will the the application dates for the Summer 2020 cohort change?

No, for now we've decided that the application window will remain the same. It will be open from April 1 until April 30.

## Hiring partners

### Can I still hire developers from you?

Yes! Our courses are still running (remotely). You can get in touch with our partnerships lead through hire@foundersandcoders.com. We are still fully operational and we look forward to supporting your search for developers.

### Can I still meet your students during this time?

Yes, we encourage all prospective and existing hiring partners to visit our virtual classroom and to sign up for virtual speaker slots on Wednesday and Friday afternoons.

## Tech for Better

Our Tech for Better programme is continuing online and with an increased focus on helping organisations respond to COVID-19. You can sign up for the programme [here](/tech-for-better).
