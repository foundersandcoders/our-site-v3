    "body": "We get asked this a lot, so we're going to elaborate a little bit here. Firstly, we prioritise a cohesive cohort of people who we think will work well together over any strong individual candidates.\n\nLearning to code is just part of what makes you a good developer. We're looking for candidates who can help us fulfil our goal of making the tech industry a more diverse and inclusive place. This means people who are excited to be part of a collaborative, peer-led learning environment. You should be willing to sacrifice some personal gain for the group's learning. For example, we'd rather a group presents a technically incomplete project than one person stays up late writing code that no one else understands.\n\nThe tech industry is disproportionately white and male. If this describes you please reflect on how you can help change this. Do some research on [how to be a good ally](https://www.guidetoallyship.com) to those who are under-represented in tech so you can be a positive influence on your cohort. \n\nFinding your own solutions to problems is an indispensable skill for a developer. We'd like you to apply these same google-skills to educating yourself on the important social issues including (but not limited to) those touched on above.\n\nFounders and Coders will always prioritise marginalised people's safety over the comfort of the privileged. **If you don't like the sound of _any_ of this then we'd ask you to reconsider your application.**"
