## More information

- ### What will I learn on this programme?

  Over four weeks, you will learn the fundamentals of product management and product ownership while working on developing a digital product with the support of your own dedicated product team, in an immersive learning-by-doing experience.

- ### What kind of product will we develop?

  We will design and build a Progressive Web Application (PWA), which looks and feels like a native mobile app, but doesn't need to be downloaded from an app store, and can be accessed using a web browser on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

- ### What is the total time commitment required of me?

  After the initial workshops, around 20 hours over the one-month product development period, testing the app, giving feedback and meeting with the developers.

- ### What if I want to continue product development after the programme ends?

  If you already have funding, we have a community of freelance developers who can help, potentially including the product team you work with on the programme.
