Your website **is** your application. You need to tell us about yourself and why you are applying for this programme. Your website also needs to demonstrate your capabilities in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Feel free to get creative with the implementation—as long as you meet all the criteria below you can have fun with it.

## Criteria

### General criteria

Your website **must** meet the following criteria:

- [ ] All code is written by you
- [ ] No external libraries (e.g. no Bootstrap, React or GitHub Pages theme, but external fonts/icons are fine)
- [ ] Tells us about why you are applying for the programme
- [ ] Hosted on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Links back to the GitHub repository that contains the code for your site
- [ ] Links to your _public_ freeCodeCamp profile
- [ ] Links to your Codewars profile

### Technical criteria

To demonstrate your learning your site **must** have at least one example of each of these: 

- [ ] Semantic HTML5 elements
- [ ] CSS grid or flexbox layout (or both)
- [ ] DOM event listeners for user interaction (e.g. click, keydown)
- [ ] DOM updates in response to user interaction (e.g. showing/hiding an element, changing text or styles)

#### Examples

Here are some example of features you could add to your site to meet all the above technical requirements. These are _just examples_—we encourage you to be creative and make something you find fun and interesting.

- **Image carousel**  
  A slideshow of images with previous/next arrow buttons that show/hide the next image in a list.
- **Tabs**  
  A set of tabs to show/hide different sections of the page when clicked.
- **Theme toggle**  
  A button that lets you switch between different style themes (e.g. light/dark)
